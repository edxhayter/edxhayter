### TLDR

Ed is an enthusiastic data problem solver. He likes the challenge of turning raw source data into data that can be used to inform descion-making. His preferred software stack is dbt sitting on top of Snowflake, with reports built in Tableau. He also likes Alteryx as a code-free solution.

### Bio

Ed graduated from Columbia University with a Masterâ€™s Degree in Political Science, building on a BA in Politics from the University of York. He enjoyed using R to parse and visualize survey data leading him to look for a role in data.

Ed has completed over 425 Alteryx Weekly Challenges and completed his Alteryx Advanced Certification within 4 months of starting to use the software. Demonstrating his drive to pick up new software and tools in the space. He enjoys helping others in the Alteryx Community with over 50 recognized solutions. For one client, Ed used Alteryx to build out a proof of concept data pipeline that would consolidate all the client's property information in a central database. For another, he developed and deployed a data refresh app to allow end users to refresh their data and save the business full-time data service staff. Ed also designed best practice workflows within Alteryx that were deployed company-wide.

Ed likes to produce a range of dashboards for his Tableau Public accumulating over 10,000 views and 400 favourites on his profile. For a client, Ed has helped save over 8 hours of internal reporting for an HR department by delivering a combination of high-level and detail dashboards on the department's operations.

Ed is continuously looking to expand his skills in data, completing Preppin' Data Challenges in SQL and sharing the code here in repositories like Preppin DBT.

Outside of work, Ed cheers on Arsenal in the Premier League, and in his free time loves to get a game of golf in.

## Sample Work

#### Github Repositories
- Explore Ed's solutions to a range of Preppin Data Challenges using a single dbt Project structure. The project includes challenge specific READMEs outlining the task and key learnings from the challenge. Find it [HERE](https://github.com/edxhayter/preppin_dbt)
- When in Alteryx Ed found the dynamic rename to be a useful tool for transformations. He utilised dbt Macros (JINJA Templating and sql) to replicate some of its functionality to save time and effort of manual renames. [Check it out](https://github.com/edxhayter/sql_dynamic_rename)
- Over a 2 day development period Ed took some of The Infomation Lab's Raw Marketing Data and created a dbt project that produces some tables that could be used to report on the Companies Linkedin Activities. [HERE](https://github.com/edxhayter/dbt_sql_Hackathon) is the Repository
- The SQL Murder Mystery is a classic introduction to sql queries. Explore Ed's path to solving the Murder Mystery including a Readme that includes sample query results to explain how he got to the solution. Crimesolving [HERE](https://github.com/edxhayter/SQL-Murder-Mystery)
