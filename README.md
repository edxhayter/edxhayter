# TLDR

I’m an enthusiastic data problem solver who thrives on transforming raw data into actionable insights. My go-to tech stack includes dbt on Snowflake, with reporting in Tableau, though I also enjoy leveraging Alteryx for no-code solutions. I also have experience working with Google Cloud Platform

# Bio

I graduated from Columbia University with a Master’s in Political Science, building on a BA in Politics from the University of York. My journey into data began with using R to analyze and visualize survey data during my studies, which sparked my passion for data-driven problem-solving.

In my professional journey:

- I’ve completed over 425 Alteryx Weekly Challenges and earned Alteryx Advanced Certification within four months of starting with the platform. I’m proud to contribute actively to the Alteryx Community, with over 50 recognized solutions.
- For one client, I created a proof-of-concept data pipeline to consolidate property data into a central database.
- For another, I deployed a data refresh app that allowed end users to refresh their data independently, eliminating the need for full-time data services staff.
- I’ve also designed best-practice workflows in Alteryx for company-wide deployment.

- My Tableau Public dashboards have accumulated over 10,000 views and 400 favorites. A few of my favorite projects include:
- Saving 8+ hours of reporting time for an HR department with high-level and detailed dashboards.
- Exploring diverse datasets, from retail KPIs to NFL combine performance.

I’m also continuously honing my skills, tackling Preppin’ Data challenges in SQL and sharing my work in repositories like Preppin DBT.

Outside work, I’m a devoted Arsenal fan and enjoy golfing in my free time.

# Sample Work

## Github Repositories
- Explore my solutions to a range of Preppin Data Challenges using a single dbt Project structure. The project includes challenge specific READMEs outlining the task and key learnings from the challenge. Find it [HERE](https://github.com/edxhayter/preppin_dbt)
- When in Alteryx I found the dynamic rename to be a useful tool for transformations. I utilised dbt Macros (JINJA Templating and sql) to replicate some of its functionality to save time and effort of manual renames. [Check it out](https://github.com/edxhayter/sql_dynamic_rename)
- Over a 2 day development period I took some of The Infomation Lab's Raw Marketing Data and created a dbt project that produces some tables that could be used to report on the Companies Linkedin Activities. [HERE](https://github.com/edxhayter/dbt_sql_Hackathon) is the Repository
- The SQL Murder Mystery is a classic introduction to sql queries. Explore my path to solving the Murder Mystery including a Readme that includes sample query results to explain how he got to the solution. Crimesolving [HERE](https://github.com/edxhayter/SQL-Murder-Mystery)
